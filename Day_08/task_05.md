# String Builder
```python
chars = []
```
first we declare an empty list.
After that we run a loop.
```python
for i in range(n):
  chars.append("c")
```
This will check the id and address of the stored variable.
```python
s = "".join(chars)
```
the list is joined with a ''  and our work here is done!!!
